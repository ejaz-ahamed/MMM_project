# mmm_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Key Features

### State Management with Provider

We utilize the `provider` package for efficient state management in this project. Provider allows us to manage the state of our application in a simple, scalable, and testable way.

### API Calls with Dio

For making API calls and handling network requests, we rely on the `dio` package. Dio provides a convenient and powerful way to interact with RESTful APIs, offering features like request cancellation, file downloading, and more.

### Model Class Generation with Freezed

To streamline the process of creating data models, we leverage the `freezed` package. Freezed helps us generate immutable data classes with ease, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring type safety.

## Generating Code with Build Runner

We use the `build_runner` tool to generate Dart code for our freezed models. By running `dart run build_runner build` command, we automatically generate the necessary code, saving time and effort in the development process.
